# NetBox HealthCheck Plugin

NetBox provides health check monitors that can be queried to make sure that the service is running in good condition.  

NetBox exposes metrics at the `/healthcheck` HTTP endpoint, e.g. `https://netbox.local/plugins/netbox_healthcheck_plugin/healthcheck`. It allows monitor conditions via HTTP(S), with responses available in HTML and JSON formats.

## Compatibility

| NetBox Version | Plugin Version |
|----------------|----------------|
|     3.4        |      0.1.0     |

## Installing

For adding to a NetBox Docker setup see
[the general instructions for using netbox-docker with plugins](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker/wiki/Using-Netbox-Plugins).

While this is still in development and not yet on pypi you can install with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox_healthcheck_plugin
```

or by adding to your `local_requirements.txt` or `plugin_requirements.txt` (netbox-docker):

```bash
git+https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox_healthcheck_plugin
```

Enable the plugin in `/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`,
 or if you use netbox-docker, your `/configuration/plugins.py` file:

```python
PLUGINS = [
    'netbox_healthcheck_plugin'
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox_healthcheck_plugin": {
        "navigation": True
    },
}*
**Note**: `"navigation":False` will remove the link on the navigation bar.
```
Then you will need to run the `migrate` function:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

## Setting up Monitoring

NetBox makes use of the [django-health-check](https://github.com/revsys/django-health-check) library, more information on setting up monitors can be found at [Setting up Monitoring](https://django-health-check.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#setting-up-monitoring):
